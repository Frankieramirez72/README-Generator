## Installation
For successful operation of the application in your terminal, it's important that you have node installed. Furthermore, execute the npm i inquirer@8.2.4 command within your terminal. These actions are vital as they ensure proper functioning, given that sizable modules are intentionally hidden in the GitHub repository using git ignore.
